# Prime-Engine-The-Last-Stand
A game that I helped developed/designed over the course of two weeks for Game Engine Development Course. 

This acted as our final project which we were able to present at USC Fall GamePipe Showcase. It is a tank survival game that requries plays to destroy the objective while surviving against a horde of zombies. 

My role was to design the level, implement different zombie behaviors, bug-fixing, and controls. 

Attached are images of gameplay.
